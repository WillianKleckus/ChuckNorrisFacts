# ChuckNorrisFacts

## Description: 
 - This is the second version of this app I made as a challenge from Stone Payments. After one month working for them, I learned a lot of stuff. The app may not have changed that much appearance-wise, but on code organization... Oh boy... I left the older code on the master branch, and made this one the default, if you wish to compare both of them.

## How the app looks:

 - The app looks fairly simple. It displays the joke cards and the search field.
